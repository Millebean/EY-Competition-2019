# EY-Competition-2019
The project comes from the EY NextWave Data Science Challenge 2019, focusing on future smart city thrive. The data consists of a vast number of anonymous geolocation records from the US city of Atlanta. Our goal is to produce a model that helps authorities to understand the journeys of citizens while they move in the city throughout the day.
